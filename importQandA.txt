thank you
1. Tell me about yourself and your experience in manual software testing.
(Take a moment to talk about your background, skills, and specific testing projects you've worked on.)

2. What is the difference between functional testing and non-functional testing?
(Explain the differences, provide examples of each, and maybe mention how you’ve worked on them in your past projects.)

3. Can you walk me through a typical software testing lifecycle?
(You can describe the phases involved and your role in each phase. For example, test planning, test design, test execution, and reporting.)

4. What types of testing have you been involved with in your previous projects (e.g., smoke testing, regression testing, UAT, etc.)?
(Describe the different types of testing you've done and any specific scenarios where you applied them.)

5. How do you approach creating test cases? What key elements do you consider?
(Walk through your process for writing test cases, including what information is crucial to include, such as test inputs, expected results, preconditions, and postconditions.)

6. How do you ensure that your test cases are effective and comprehensive?
(Explain how you make sure your test cases cover all scenarios, edge cases, and requirements, and how you ensure that no critical tests are overlooked.)

7. Can you explain what is a "bug life cycle"?
(Describe the stages a bug goes through from discovery to resolution. Mention states like New, Assigned, Fixed, Retested, and Closed.)

8. Have you ever encountered a situation where you could not reproduce a defect? How did you handle it?
(Describe a situation where a defect could not be reproduced and how you investigated it. Did you ask for more details, check logs, or work with the development team?)

9. What are the differences between Severity and Priority in defect management? Can you give an example of each?
(Explain how severity refers to the impact of a defect on functionality, and priority refers to how soon the defect should be fixed. You can give examples like a minor UI issue being low severity but high priority in some cases.)
10. How do you handle situations when there is insufficient information to test a feature or functionality?
(Describe how you seek clarification from developers, business analysts, or stakeholders to gather the necessary information to proceed with testing.)
11. What is your approach to testing web applications versus mobile applications? Are there any differences in how you test them?
(Discuss specific differences in testing web apps vs. mobile apps, such as screen resolutions, touch gestures, performance under varying network conditions, etc.)
12. How do you manage time when testing under tight deadlines? How do you prioritize which tests to run?
(Explain how you prioritize critical tests, such as those that affect functionality, business logic, or high-risk areas, and how you balance thoroughness with time constraints.)
13. Can you describe a time when you identified a critical defect during testing? How did you report it, and what steps did you take to ensure it was resolved?
(Share an example of when you found a significant defect, how you communicated it to the team, and what actions were taken to fix the issue.)
14. How do you handle situations when you disagree with a developer regarding the severity or resolution of a defect?
(Describe how you handle conflicts or disagreements with the development team while ensuring the issue is resolved in a professional and constructive way.)
15. Can you explain what "Regression Testing" is and when it should be performed?
(Explain regression testing in the context of ensuring new changes don't negatively affect existing functionality. Mention when it's typically performed — after bug fixes, enhancements, or new features.)
16. What tools have you used in your testing work, if any? Have you used any test management tools?
(Discuss any tools you’ve worked with, such as test management tools like JIRA, TestRail, or quality management platforms. Also mention if you’ve worked with bug tracking or version control tools.)
17. How do you track and report defects? What information do you include in a bug report?
(Talk about your process for logging defects, ensuring they contain sufficient details such as steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, screenshots, and environment details.)
18. Can you explain the difference between "Sanity Testing" and "Smoke Testing"?
(Provide a clear explanation of both: Smoke Testing is a basic check to see if the application is stable enough for more detailed testing, while Sanity Testing ensures that specific functionality works after a change.)
19. How do you ensure the software is ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)?
(Discuss your role in preparing the software for UAT, such as ensuring all requirements are met, testing is complete, and no critical issues remain.)
20. Finally, why do you think manual testing is important even in the age of automation?
(Give your perspective on why manual testing still plays a key role in areas like exploratory testing, user experience testing, and cases where automation isn't feasible.)
